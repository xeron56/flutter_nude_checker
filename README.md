The `flutter_nude_checker` package provides a simple way to detect nude images in Flutter apps. It uses the [yahoo open_nsfw](https://github.com/yahoo/open_nsfw) model to detect nude images. The model is able to detect nudity with better accuracy.


## Features

- Detect nude images in Flutter apps
- Detect nudity with GPU acceleration
- Detect nudity in images from the internet or from the device's gallery



## Installation

1. Add this package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter_nude_checker: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Usage
Download the tflite model from [here](https://github.com/xeron56/flutter_nude_checker/releases/download/1.0.0/nsfw.tflite) and add it to the assets folder of your project. Then, add the following code to your project to detect nude images:

```dart
  Future<void> _getNSFWScore() async {
    
    final modelPath = await getModelPath("nsfw.tflite");

    final picker = ImagePicker();
    try {
      final XFile? image = await picker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.gallery); // You can also use ImageSource.camera for the camera
      if (image != null) {
        final nsfwScore =
            await FlutterNudeChecker.getNSFWScore(image.path, modelPath);
        print("NSFW Score: ${nsfwScore.nsfwScore}");
       
      } else {
        print("No image selected.");
      }
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error: $e");
    }
  }
```
